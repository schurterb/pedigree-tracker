## Bug Fix: Missing Potential Parents API Endpoint

### Task: Debug
- Identified bug in "Add Animal" form where parent dropdowns weren't populating
- Found that the frontend was calling a non-existent API endpoint: `/api/v1/animal-types/<id>/potential-parents`

### Task: Implementation
- Added new `AnimalTypePotentialParents` resource class to `animal_type.py`
- Implemented endpoint to filter animals by type ID and gender
- Endpoint returns properly formatted JSON data for mother and father dropdowns

### Task: Testing
- Restarted application server to apply changes
- Verified API endpoint works correctly (200 status code in logs)
- Confirmed parent selection dropdowns now populate correctly in the UI
