```

| [Settings Bar]    |                                                         |

|                                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

All fields are directly editable on this screen. The user can either save the new animal or cancel the operation.

## Pedigree Visualization

The pedigree visualization in the main area shows a family tree structure:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                       |
|                  [Great Grandparent]                  |
|                          |                            |
|                          |                            |
|             [Grandparent]      [Grandparent]          |
|                   |                |                  |
|                   |                |                  |
|             [Mother]          [Father]                |
|                    \              /                   |
|                     \            /                    |
|                     [Selected Animal]                 |
|                     /            \                    |
|                    /              \                   |
|            [Offspring]       [Offspring]              |
|                                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Animal Detail View

When an animal is selected, its details can be viewed and edited directly in the main area:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Animal Details: Choco Chip        [Save] [Pedigree]   |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                       |
| Basic Information:                                    |
| ID/Tag: [H001]                Type: [Horse]           |
| Name: [Choco Chip]            Gender: [‚ôÄ Female ‚ñº]    |
| Date of Birth: [03/15/2022]                           |
|                                                       |
| Lineage:                                              |
| Mother: [Sugar Cube (H023) ‚ñº]                         |
| Father: [Dark Thunder (H017) ‚ñº]                       |
|                                                       |
| Notes:                                                |
| [Brown mare with white star marking on forehead.     ]|
| [Good temperament, trained for basic riding.         ]|
| [Purchased from Highland Farm in March 2023.         ]|
|                                                       |
| Offspring:                                            |
| - Cocoa Bean (H045) - born 04/12/2024                 |
| - Mocha Swirl (H052) - born 05/20/2025                |
|                                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

All fields appear as editable inputs or selects, allowing the user to make changes directly in this view. The user can save changes or switch to the Pedigree view. Offspring are displayed but not directly editable from this screen - they must be edited from their own details view.

## Settings and Controls

The settings bar at the bottom of the sidebar includes:

```
+-------------------+
| ‚öôÔ∏è | üìÑ | ? | ... |
+-------------------+
```

- ‚öôÔ∏è - General settings
- üìÑ - Export/import data
- ? - Help/documentation
- ... - Additional options

## Mobile Layout Adaptation

On mobile devices, the layout adapts:

1. Animal type tabs remain at top, but scroll horizontally if needed
2. Animal list becomes a slide-out panel from the left
3. Main area takes full width when list is hidden
4. Add button remains fixed in top-right position
5. Bottom settings bar remains accessible

## Design Notes

1. **Simplicity First**: The layout prioritizes the most common tasks (viewing animals by type and seeing pedigrees)
2. **Consistent Visual Language**: Gender symbols and color-coding make scanning the list easier
3. **Task-Based Organization**: UI is organized around the primary workflows (selecting types, viewing/adding animals)
4. **Minimal Modal Use**: Only forms that require focus (like adding animals) use modal dialogs
5. **Visual Pedigrees**: The pedigree display is central to the application's purpose and takes the largest screen area
