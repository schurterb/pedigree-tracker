# Pedigree Tracker Canvas Connections Implementation

**Date:** 2025-05-11  
**Task:** Implement smooth continuous connecting lines between animals in the pedigree view

## Overview

Implemented a canvas-based approach to draw smooth connecting lines between related animals in the pedigree view. This replaces the previous CSS-based approach that used pseudo-elements to create rigid connection lines.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Canvas Element
- Added a canvas element as a background layer in the pedigree container
- Canvas is positioned absolutely to cover the entire container
- Animal cards are positioned on top of the canvas

### 2. JavaScript Implementation
- Created a new `PedigreeCanvas` class that manages the canvas
- Implemented functions to draw bezier curves between animal cards
- Added automatic positioning based on DOM layout
- Included responsiveness to window resizing

### 3. CSS Updates
- Added new styles to properly position the canvas and animal cards
- Removed previous CSS pseudo-element connection lines
- Made sure animal cards remain interactive while the canvas is in the background

### 4. File Structure
- Created `pedigree-canvas.js` for the JavaScript implementation
- Added `pedigree-canvas.css` for specialized styles
- Updated `index.html` to include the new files

## Future Enhancements
- Allow dynamic addition/removal of animals with updated connections
- Implement animated drawing of connection lines
- Add configuration options for line styles and curve shapes
- Optimize performance for large pedigrees with many connections

## Testing Notes
- Works well in modern browsers with canvas support
- Responsive to window resizing
- Maintains interactive elements despite canvas overlay
