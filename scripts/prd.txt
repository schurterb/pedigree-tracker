# Overview  
The Pedigree Tracker is a specialized tool designed for farmers and breeders to maintain comprehensive records of their livestock's ancestry and genealogical information. This application solves the problem of tracking complex family relationships between farm animals, which is crucial for effective breeding programs, avoiding inbreeding, and maintaining genetic diversity. It provides an intuitive interface for visualizing multi-generational pedigrees, enabling users to make informed breeding decisions and manage their animal populations effectively.

# Core Features  

## Animal Type Management
- **What it does**: Enables users to create, edit, and delete different animal types (e.g., cattle, horses, sheep)
- **Why it's important**: Provides flexibility to support various livestock species with their unique identification needs
- **How it works**: Users can define animal types with unique names and optional descriptions through a simple interface

## Animal Management
- **What it does**: Allows users to catalog and maintain detailed records of individual animals
- **Why it's important**: Creates a comprehensive database of all animals with their identifiers, attributes, and parental relationships
- **How it works**: Each animal record includes unique identifier, name (optional), type, gender, date of birth, parents (if known), and status, with support for additional notes and descriptions

## Pedigree Visualization
- **What it does**: Generates visual pedigree trees showing an animal's ancestry across multiple generations
- **Why it's important**: Enables users to understand complex genealogical relationships at a glance
- **How it works**: Dynamically renders pedigree charts up to 5 generations deep, properly handling missing parent information and highlighting genetic relationships

## Data Export
- **What it does**: Exports pedigree charts as PNG images for printing or external use
- **Why it's important**: Allows users to share information or maintain physical records
- **How it works**: Converts the visualized pedigree chart to a high-quality image file via HTML-to-Canvas conversion

# User Experience  

## User Personas
1. **Small Farm Owner**: Manages a modest collection of animals, needs basic record-keeping and pedigree visualization
2. **Professional Breeder**: Works with specific breeds, requires detailed pedigree information for genetic planning
3. **Livestock Manager**: Oversees large populations of animals, needs efficient filtering and search capabilities

## Key User Flows
1. **Animal Type Setup**: User creates animal types relevant to their farm operations
2. **Animal Record Creation**: User adds new animals to the system, including their parental relationships
3. **Pedigree Exploration**: User selects an animal and visualizes its ancestry to various generations
4. **Animal Information Update**: User updates animal status, notes, or corrects information
5. **Pedigree Export**: User exports a pedigree chart for printing or sharing

## UI/UX Considerations
- **Tab-Based Navigation**: Horizontal tabs for switching between animal types
- **Two-Panel Layout**: Animal list sidebar + main content area for details/pedigree view
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear gender symbols (♀/♂) and status indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining usability
- **Minimal Modal Use**: Direct inline editing of animal details where possible
